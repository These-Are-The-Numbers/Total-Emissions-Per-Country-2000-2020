# 7670 DAYS (January 1st, 2000 to December 31st, 2020)
This is a dataset that tracks the **sources** of emission, **types** of emission, and **total emissions** (CH4, N2O, CO2, etc.) per country from **2000** to **2020**.

All data are official figures from the United Nations's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) that have been compiled and structured by myself. What sets this dataset apart from similar ones is the inclusion of emissions **OUTSIDE** of CO2 such as CH4 and N2O. Additionally, emission data for each country is separated depending on the source of the emissions, which heightens the analytical potential of the dataset. Just to make it clear, all units featured in this dataset are in *kilotonnes*.

Why did I create this dataset? As global warming becomes worse, countries across the globe will look to **shift the blame** for environmental consequences on one another. By providing a dataset that tracks emission per country, I hope to keep countries **accountable** for their contributions to the crisis. Additionally, achieving a **quantitative yet objective viewpoint** of a subject such as global warming is crucial to understanding the issues at hand.

# Data Sources
##### The primary data source used was the United Nations's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) website, which publishes tabular data pertaining to global environmental issues. Considering the meticulous documentation of government statistics by such a legally constituted IGO, no other authority is more equipped to provide insight on emission rates.

1. [The Food and Agriculture Organization's  ](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GT) - The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has published yearly updates on unemployment rates since 1961. However, I narrowed down the time period covered to 20 years for simplicity's sake. 
2. [The Food and Agriculture Organization's  ](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#definitions) - The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) released a detailed overview of their emissions data, the methodology behind their data, and the proper definitions and terminologies for the variables tracked. The guide mainly provided essential contextual knowledge needed to create a meaningful dataset.

# Statistics Being Tracked
- Area (Country)
- Item (Source of Emission)
- Element (Type of Emission)
- Unit (Emissions = Kilotonnes)
- Year (Total Emissions for Each Year, 2000 - 2020)

# Dataset History
2023-03-02 - Dataset is created (8,462 days after temporal coverage start date).
